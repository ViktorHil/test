* Release 2006-02-12

- Fixed bug in usb-windows.c: If device was not found, we accepted the last
  device seen which could be opened. This bug also leaked handles when multipe
  HIDs were opened during device matching.
- Fixed libusb based HID interface for Linux: Need to detach kernel side HID
  driver before we can communicate with the device. Behave correctly: set
  configuration and claim interface.
- Added a Windows makefile "Makefile.windows".

  Changelog for details.
